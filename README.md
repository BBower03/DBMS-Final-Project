This is a text based application for a very basic gym member ship management system. A DDL and DML file are included in the repository for testing purposes. The code is not seperated into files, as it is a simple application without any classes. functions are organized by which part of the project they correspond to. No bugs are known at this time. All interaction with the application is done via number input in the command line.
