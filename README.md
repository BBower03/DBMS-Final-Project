This is a text based application for a very basic gym member ship management system. A DDL and DML file are included in the repository for testing purposes. The code is not seperated into files, as it is a simple application without any classes. functions are organized by which part of the project they correspond to. No bugs are known at this time. All interaction with the application is done via number input in the command line.

The necessary ER diagram and relational schema can be found in the files er_diagram_v2.PNG and relational_schema.PNG, respectively.

Assumptions for the ER diagram:
              Requirement: a user can log in as either a member, trainer, or admin staff.
               Assumption: this means that we can assume that members, trainers, and admin cannot exist without users.
Representation in diagram: we have a 'must have' participation for user, since without it, we cannot have any participation in the gym system by the way of members, trainers, or admin staff.

              Requirement: gym members can be signed up for multiple classes.
               Assumption: this means that we can assume that we can have multiple class instances for a single member.
